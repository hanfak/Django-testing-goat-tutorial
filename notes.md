Additional stuff to get it working

Before:

Create virtual environment, and install django and selenium as per book instructions

Chapter 1.1

Need to download gecko driver for firefox to run with selenium. This needs to be unzipped and moved to /usr/local/bin, use CLI `mv <file> /usr/local/bin`

https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/py/docs/source/index.rst

To create project, `django-admin startproject superlists`

To leave virtual environment `deactivate`

Chapter 1.2
